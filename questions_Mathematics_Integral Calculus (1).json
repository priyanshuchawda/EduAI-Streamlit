    "explanation": "Let I = \u222b\u2080^\u221e x^2 * e^(-x^2) dx. Substitute u = x^2, so x = \u221au and dx = (1/2)u^(-1/2) du. The integral becomes I = \u222b\u2080^\u221e u * e^(-u) * (1/2)u^(-1/2) du = (1/2) \u222b\u2080^\u221e u^(1/2) * e^(-u) du = (1/2) \u0393(3/2). Since \u0393(3/2) = (1/2)\u0393(1/2) and \u0393(1/2) = \u221a\u03c0, then I = (1/2) * (1/2)\u221a\u03c0 = \u221a\u03c0 / 4.",

    "difficulty": "hard",
    "expected_time": "9",
    "marks": "7",
    "answer": "1/24",
    "explanation": "We can solve this using a substitution or by relating it to the Beta function.  Let's use the Beta function approach. The integral can be expressed as (1/2)B(3,4) where B(m,n) = \u0393(m)\u0393(n)/\u0393(m+n). Therefore, the integral becomes (1/2)*\u0393(3)\u0393(4)/\u0393(7) = (1/2)*(2!*3!)/6! = (1/2)*(2*6)/720 = 1/60. Alternatively, we can use the reduction formula for \u222bsin^m(x)cos^n(x) dx. However, the Beta function is more efficient here. Let's try another method. Since cos\u00b3(x) = cos(x)cos\u00b2(x) = cos(x)(1-sin\u00b2(x)), we can rewrite the integral as \u222b\u2080^(\u03c0/2) sin\u2075(x) cos(x) (1-sin\u00b2(x)) dx. Let u = sin(x), then du = cos(x) dx. The integral becomes \u222b\u2080\u00b9 u\u2075(1-u\u00b2) du = \u222b\u2080\u00b9 (u\u2075 - u\u2077) du = [u\u2076/6 - u\u2078/8]\u2080\u00b9 = 1/6 - 1/8 = 4/24 - 3/24 = 1/24.",

    "explanation": "The total distance is given by \u222b\u2080^(2\u03c0) |t * cos(t)| dt. cos(t) is negative from \u03c0/2 to 3\u03c0/2. Therefore, we need to split the integral: \u222b\u2080^(\u03c0/2) t * cos(t) dt - \u222b_(\u03c0/2)^(3\u03c0/2) t * cos(t) dt + \u222b_(3\u03c0/2)^(2\u03c0) t * cos(t) dt. We integrate t*cos(t) by parts: \u222b t*cos(t) dt = t*sin(t) - \u222b sin(t) dt = t*sin(t) + cos(t) + C. Now evaluate the definite integrals: [t*sin(t) + cos(t)]\u2080^(\u03c0/2) - [t*sin(t) + cos(t)]_(\u03c0/2)^(3\u03c0/2) + [t*sin(t) + cos(t)]_(3\u03c0/2)^(2\u03c0). This simplifies to (\u03c0/2 - 1) - (-3\u03c0/2 - \u03c0/2) + (1 - (-3\u03c0/2)) = \u03c0/2 - 1 + 2\u03c0 + 1 + 3\u03c0/2 = 4\u03c0.",
